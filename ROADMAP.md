## Aims ##

### Simulate 8.5 million agents ###

- Can thinks be done easily with ApeSDK? New memory? New simulation methods? Reduced memory/agent footprint? __simulatedape__ with this many agents?

### Agent pathing ###

- Improved movement

- Proper use of doors and windows

### Good simulation environment ###

- MapEdit from __urban__ used

- Maybe starting off with __urban__ (created simulation space) moving to London (from __mapout/mapblend__)

- Need Improved/Universal JSON format

- London in smaller “squares” allow for improved map editing and visualization.

- Plotting internals of buildings from __mapout/mapblend__ using __urban__ building internals.

### Occupations ###

- Ideally about 400 with about 100 occupation hierarchies

- Rather than using telephone book a good spread of occupations and interactions providing best methods

- Simulating night and day occupations

### Accurate simulation of movement ###

### Currency implicit or explicit? ###

- Can value/money be extracted independently? If so how accurate?

### Class? Hierarchies? ###
