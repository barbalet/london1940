File format explained

Sim Sea Lion supports standard file names with the addition of a date/time stamp in the file name that is special. These files:

new_ashford.json

new_ashford.png

The JSON file when save becomes:

new_ashford(220511_210516).json

If the file was previously:

new_ashford(220511_210021).json

It would be re-saved as:

new_ashford(220511_233149).json

This corresponds to:

new_ashford.png

You can have many JSON files to one PNG file. You always drop the JSON file into the app to pick up the PNG file and the correct JSON to open.
